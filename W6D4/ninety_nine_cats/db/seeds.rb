# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# can use this in Rails Console:

# kitty1 = Cat.new(birth_date: "2016/1/1", color: "blue", name: "Waffle", sex: "M", description: "I'm delicious!")
# kitty2 = Cat.new(birth_date: "1999/12/20", color: "red", name: "Jazz", sex: "F", description: "A cool cat.")
